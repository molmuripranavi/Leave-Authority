## Leave-Authority
## Problem Statement : 
The current leave approval process in colleges for both day scholars and hostelers is manual, time‑consuming, and often leads to delays, miscommunication, and lack of proper tracking. Students need permission from class teachers and the Head of Department (HOD) for academic leave, and hostelers additionally require approval for outings . Therefore, there is a need to develop a Smart Leave Application App that allows students to submit leave and outing requests digitally and enables faculty and hostel authorities to review, approve, or reject requests efficiently

## APP NAME : Leave Authority

## Idea Description : 
The Leave Application App is a mobile application designed for college students to submit leave requests digitally. Students can apply for leave by entering essential details such as name, roll number, department, section, date of leave, reason, and duration. Once a request is submitted, the application automatically forwards it to the class teacher and the Head of Department (HOD) for approval.
Teachers and HOD’s can conveniently review, approve, or reject requests directly through their dashboards in the app. For hosteler students, the outing requests are additionally routed to hostel authorities for verification and approval.
This system improves communication, maintains proper digital records, reduces delays, and ensures a transparent and efficient leave approval process.
